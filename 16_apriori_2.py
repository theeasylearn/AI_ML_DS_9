### Movie Recommendation Using Apriori
In this example, the Apriori algorithm is used to discover relationships between movies based on users' movie preferences. A real-world MovieLens dataset is used, where each user has rated multiple movies.

For association rule mining, movies with a sufficiently high rating are considered movies that the user **liked**. Each user's collection of liked movies is treated as a single transaction. Apriori then identifies frequently occurring combinations of movies and generates association rules based on their support, confidence, and lift.

For example, if many users who liked **Movie A** also liked **Movie B**, Apriori may generate the rule:

**Movie A → Movie B**

This rule can then be used to recommend **Movie B** to users who have shown interest in **Movie A**.

The objective of this example is to demonstrate how **Association Rule Learning can be applied to a real-world movie recommendation problem**.
